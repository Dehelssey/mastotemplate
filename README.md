# MastOz
Dark + Green modern template with animated rainbow hover effects **just because**

this theme consists in just a few tweaks applied to [#Abdullah Tarawneh (trwnh)](https://userstyles.org/users/573237)'s own [MFC - Mastodon Flat CSS](https://userstyles.org/styles/153362/mfc-mastodon-flat-css)'s theme who made the biggest part of the job here.

to apply this theme to your Mastodon's instance used Stylus for Firefox, create a new style for your instance url and copy+paste provided CSS :)

### that's all folks !

(remember you have to do it on every browser you use, those tweaks are stored in your browser not on your instance)
